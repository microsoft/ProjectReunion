## Contributing

_We want to hear from you!_

File a [new issue!](https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion/issues/new/choose) Tell us what problem you're
trying to solve, how you've tried to solve it so far, and what would be the ideal solution for your app.  Bonus
points if there's a gist or existing repo we can look at with you.


1. **[Ask a question](https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion/issues/new?assignees=&labels=question&template=question.md&title=Question%3A+%5Byour+question+here%5D)**<br>
    Also, have a look at our [frequently asked questions](faq.md) page which we will update often.

2. **[Start a discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion/discussions)**<br>
   Discussions can be about any topics or ideas related to the Windows App SDK. For example,
   you might start a Discussion issue to see if others are interested in a cool new idea
   you've been thinking about that isn't quite ready to be filed as a more formal Feature Proposal.

3. **[Make a feature proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature+proposal&template=feature-proposal.md&title=)**<br>
   What components do you want to see in the Windows App SDK? For example you can propose a new API on an existing type, or an idea for a new API.
   It's fine if you don't have all the details: you can start with a summary and rationale.


**Over time, we will add Windows App SDK code and samples into this repo and provide code contribution/developer guidelines.**
